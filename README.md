# ParticleMultiplicity-LinearRegression
This repository contains a Python-based machine learning project that applies log-linear regression to analyze the relationship between transverse momentum and particle multiplicity. The data, originally generated by the Pythia particle generator, has been converted from .root format to a more accessible .npy format for ease of use. The project utilizes NumPy for data manipulation, Matplotlib for visualization, and scikit-learn for implementing and evaluating the linear regression model, taking into account sample weights for more accurate predictions.
