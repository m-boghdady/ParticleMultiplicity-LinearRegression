## Overview
The `ParticlePhysicsAnalysis` repository contains a Python-based machine learning project focusing on the analysis of particle collision data. It utilizes linear regression to explore the relationship between transverse momentum and particle multiplicity, a crucial aspect in high-energy physics studies.

## Features
- **Data Handling and Transformation**: The project handles data generated by the Pythia particle generator, originally in .root format, converted into a usable .npy format for easier manipulation.
- **Machine Learning Implementation**: Employs scikit-learn's linear regression model, tailored to fit the specific nature of high-energy particle collision data.
- **Advanced Data Analysis Techniques**: Utilizes log-linear regression to deal with the non-linear nature of the relationship between transverse momentum and particle multiplicity.
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib is used to create insightful visual representations of the data and the model's predictions, aiding in the interpretation of results.
- **Performance Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Usage
To use this project:
1. Ensure Python and the required libraries (numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn) are installed.
2. Load the particle collision data from the provided .npy file.
3. Run the script to perform the analysis and view the results, both numerically and visually.

## Technical Description
The project starts by loading particle collision data and transforming it appropriately. Transverse momenta are calculated based on array indices, and the multiplicity values are log-transformed to linearize the relationship. The data is then split into training and testing sets. A weighted linear regression model is created and trained using scikit-learn, with sample weights derived from the original multiplicity values. The script then evaluates the model's performance and visualizes both the data and the model's predictions.

## Note
This project is suited for researchers and students in the field of particle physics or anyone interested in the application of machine learning techniques in physical data analysis.
